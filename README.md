# Dyanmic Tables with JavaScript & HTML

### Project Overview
Tasked with creating a dynamic webpage utilizing data stored in a JavaScript array. To make the webpage fully dynamic, filters must be added to the webpage. This means the webpage can react to user-input. Then the dynamic webpage must be placed in a HTML file for easy viewing. The webpage is to be customized with Bootstrap. The page must be able to allow the user to interact with the visualizations. The webpage will be focusing on UFO sightings which is the data stored in the JavaScript Array.

In short:
- Allow the user to input the filters they want
- filter by state, city, country, and shape
- save previous filter searches to console.log

### Technologies Used
- JavaScript
 - ES6
 - Dynamic Tables
- HTML & CSS

##### How To Use The Page

The first step is to locate the filter input on the bottom left

The next step is to fill in your data for what you want to find

Then you get the filtered result

### Summary
One major drawback is that the input fields only accept exact results (like only lowercases and no misplaced spaces). This could be solved with some dedicated work on a function that takes a user input and autolowercases it and removes white space.
Two further recommendations would be to bring back the filter button/add a delay for filtering by the user input. Sometimes you don't always want to move onto a futher search or are referencing a current search. Another filter by newest dat or closest to me feature would be fun and drive up interaction and curiosity of the customers.
