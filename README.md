# UFOs and Javascript

### Project Overview
The client reached out to me and asked if it was possible to create a dynamic webpage dedicated to UFO Sightings. I was provided with a big database of 'UFO' sightings and was given the following task(s):
1. Allow the user to input the filters they want
2. filter by state, city, country, and shape
3. save previous filter searches to console.log
