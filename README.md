# UFOs and Javascript

### Project Overview
The client reached out to me and asked if it was possible to create a dynamic webpage dedicated to UFO Sightings. I was provided with a big database of 'UFO' sightings and was given the following task(s):
1. Allow the user to input the filters they want
2. filter by state, city, country, and shape
3. save previous filter searches to console.log

### Results


### Summary
One major drawback is that the input fields only accept exact results (like only lowercases and no misplaced spaces). This could be solved with some dedicated work on a function that takes a user input and autolowercases it and removes white space.
Two further recommendations would be to bring back the filter button/add a delay for filtering by the user input. Sometimes you don't always want to move onto a futher search or are referencing a current search. Another filter by newest dat or closest to me feature would be fun and drive up interaction and curiosity of the customers.
